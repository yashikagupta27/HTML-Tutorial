# HTML Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning HTML. It includes hands-on projects where I applied fundamental concepts to build practical web components like forms and tables.

## Key Features

* 📝 **Basic Forms:** A collection of forms demonstrating the use of various input types, including text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submission buttons.
* 📅 **Data Tables:** Examples of well-structured tables used to organize and display data clearly.

## What I Learned 🧠

Through this project, I gained a solid understanding of core HTML concepts, including:

* **Semantic HTML:** Using tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>` to give structure and meaning to the content.
* **Form Elements:** Mastering `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>` to create interactive forms.
* **Table Structure:** Properly using `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` for data representation.
* **Linking & Media:** Implementing anchor tags `<a>` for navigation and embedding images with `<img>`.
